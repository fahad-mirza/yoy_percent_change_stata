# Year on Year Percentage Change Plot using Stata

Trying out visualizing a year on year percentage change plot for multiple groups.

The Data contains information on 3 types of school categories: High, Secondary, & Primary. The fourth category is the total of these 3. Year on year change is then
calculated and then it is visualized.

The code makes use of twoway bar plot with scheme from Asjad Naqvi's Schemepack (white_tableau).
